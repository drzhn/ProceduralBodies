# ProceduralBodies
Playdead's "INSIDE"-inspired GPU simulation of multiple (up to 8000) connected bodies. Instancing, collision detection, skinning, inverse kinematics are fully calculated on the GPU. I used Unity3D batched RaycastCommand for detecting collision with ground.

Based on the [Position Based Dynamics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf) article.
